# Project Name
> This project is used to predict the housing price value of a dataset with feature variables. Theis project mainly aims to demonstrate the use of lasso and ridge regression (regularization).

## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- We are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Suggestions for Surprise Housing is to keep a check on these predictors affecting the price of the house.
- The higher values of positive coeeficients suggest a high sale value.
- The higher values of negative coeeficients suggest a decrease in sale value.
- When the market value of the property is lower than the Predicted Sale Price, its the time to buy.
